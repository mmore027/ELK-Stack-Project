# ELK Stack Project - Network Topology
This network serves to create and deploy an Elk Stack Server and configure 2 Red Team VMS within an Azure VN to monitor the web server running DVWA.
An ELK server consists of three open-source tools called Elasticsearch, Logstash, & Kibana. Elasticsearch is the database used for storing logs, Logstash collects the logs from the machines, and Kibana provides charts and graphs so analysts are able to review the data with ease.
